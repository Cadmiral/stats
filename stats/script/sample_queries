Need to run testTables.rb (or main.rb)
run create_table.rb
run get_salaries.rb
run these two queries in DB:




UPDATE todays_games SET projected_fd_points = round((salary/1000*5),2); UPDATE todays_games SET plus_minus_percentage = round((avg_fd_points/projected_fd_points),2); DELETE FROM todays_games WHERE salary=0;

_____________




To get $ per Pts:

UPDATE todays_games SET dollar_per_point = round((salary/avg_fd_points),2);

_____________


select * from todays_games where pos='SF' AND avg_fd_points > 20 ORDER BY dollar_per_point;


_____________


alter table todays_game add column injury VARCHAR(500), add column notes VARCHAR(500);
update todays_game set (injury, notes) values (injury, notes from injury_list where todays_game.player_name = injury_list.player_name);




_____________
AVG FD_POINTS from last 3 games of specific player:

select player_name, date, avg(fd_points) over (PARTITION BY player_name order by date rows between 2 preceding and current row) from boxscore where player_name ilike '%curry%' order by date desc limit 1;

_____________
AVG FD_POINTS from last 3 games of all players playing today:

select player_name, date, avg(fd_points) over (PARTITION BY player_name order by date rows between 2 preceding and current row) AS avg_fd_points from boxscore order by date desc limit (select count(*) from players);


_____________

SELECT avg(boxscores.fd_points) AS pts_given_to_position
from boxscores INNER JOIN players on players.player_name=boxscores.player_name 
where players.pos='PG' AND boxscores.opponent='OKC';

_____________

Alter table todays_games
add column B2B DATE,
